The function of inverse matrix:
【1】The element aij in the inverse matrix represents the response XJ 
	 generated by unit bj.
【2】judge whether the matrix is ill - conditioned.

1. the elements in the coefficient matrix A are scaling in proportion, making
the maximum element of each row 1, and the inverse of the scaling matrix. If 
some elements in the inverse matrix are far greater than 1, then the equation 
group may be ill conditioned.

2. multiplying the inverse matrix with the original coefficient matrix and 
observing whether the result is approximate to the unit matrix, if not, then 
the equations are ill conditioned.

3. for inverse matrix inversion, is the observation result very close to the 
original coefficient matrix, if not, then the coefficient matrix ill condition.

//The norm of vector and matrix

//	   smallest,which means it's measurement is the most tight.
