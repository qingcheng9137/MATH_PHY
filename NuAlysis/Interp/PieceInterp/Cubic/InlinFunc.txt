MATLAB: spline:Inline Cubic Spline Function,the default condition is Not-a-Knot End Condition.
			   But if the number of variables of y is two more than that of x,it use the 
			   clamped end condition.

There are three situations for the cubic spline: 
		   natural condition: second derivative for the first and last point is 0.
		   clamped end condition: first derivative for the first and last point is fixed to some values
		   not-a-knot end condition:third derivative for the second and the second from last points is continue.
ATTENTION: Generally speaking,the conclusions of natural and not-a-knot condition is more accurate.
	       And the natural condition may lead to the curve back to straight lines.The not-a-knot 
	       condition is more like the curve itself.Reference the definitions.
		 
% generate 9 equal_distance sampling points
>> x=linspace(-1,1,9);
>> y=1./(1+25*x.^2);
% function linspace generate 100 points which have equal distance 
>> xx=linspace(-1,1);
>> yy=spline(x,y,xx);
% If we don't explain,linspace will generate 100 data points,the 
% second statement (xx,yy) means the solid lines.
>> yr=1./(1+25*xx.^2);
>> plot(x,y,'o',xx,yy,xx,yr,'--')

% 1 and -4 mean the first derivative of the first and the last point.
>> yc=[1 y -4];
>> yyc=spline(x,yc,xx);

		2[default].linear
		3[cubic].spline:always smooth.
		4[cubic].pchip/cubic:Subsection cubic Hermitian interpolation.If the data is not smooth,volatility is very small.
							 Because the curve is not outside of the known data.But spline isn't.
