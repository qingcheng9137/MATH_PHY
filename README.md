#MATH_PHY

In this repository,I will show my exploration in math and physics.Besides I'll give my detailed learning plan about
math,physics,and computer science.

I won't display all the details,since there're lots of things that I can't document by github all the time such as 
my path of learning linear algebra,which I will just give several books,a website,maybe my handed notes.

It's just a documentation of myself.No other intentions.
