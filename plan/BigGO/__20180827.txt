Yesterday I talked with Bro.Kang,who is the phd of chemistry subject.

1.I was told to begin my study career at once,which means I should go to a right
lab to do some help.What I should do is to study their newest papers,and choose 
a proper lab.A good idea is to contact with the phd Bro&Sis to know useful info.

2.Do your current job well,resist the temptation of over-interest,master your 
major,and I have a long way to go,so put your interest in other times.Just since
I don't have so much time.It's really tough to go abroad.

3.English and GPA is OK as long as they are enough.Winter break is the best choice to study English(point of him).The GRE test can greatly reduce the difficulty of TOFEL,
and the school-day time should be spent on the scientific research.

4.The paperwork application was completed in the winter vacation of the semester of
my senior year,about Dece.,which means I have two years to prepare.
