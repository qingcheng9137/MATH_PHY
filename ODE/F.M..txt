Lecture 29 introduces a pretty way to find the solutions to X'=AX(2 by 2),
which is called Matrix Exponential.And the general calculated formular for
e^(At) is XÂ·X(0)^(-1),which is a good way since we don't need to care about
anything about eigens.

My question is that X,the fundamental matrix,which consists of 2 independent
colunm vectors(both solutions to X'=AX,and they are all functions of t). However,to find the solution of the equation,we have to use eigens tool. 
And it seems that we don't have any other methods except for characteristic
equations(just eigens' method).Is there any way that we really don't need to
calculate the characteristic equations and give the F.M?And what's the real difference between matrix exponential and F.M?
